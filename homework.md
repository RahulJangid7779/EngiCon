WE DO NOT USE BROWSER TO TEST API BROWSER IS THE WORST
when ever we do an route the brower use get method
we use postman to test api
install postman app and make a workspace/collection > test the api call
write a logic to handle get post patch put delete api call and test them on postman

create multiple route handler
next() function and errors along with res.send()
