homework
you have to play with route extension ex /hello /test
order of the routes matter
WE DO NOT USE BROWSER TO TEST API BROWSER IS THE WORST
when ever we do an route the brower use get method
we use postman to test api
install postman app and make a workspace/collection > test the api call
write a logic to handle get post patch put delete api call and test them on postman
Dynamic routing
create multiple route handler
next() function and errors along with res.send()
middleware
how express js basically handle request behind the scenes
satus code
diffrence between use all get
write dummy auth middleware for admin
write a dummy auth middleware for all user route except /user/login
error handling
order of error handling is matter
try and catch is the correct way of writing error
